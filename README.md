## Testing

Having written my code for each .html page I have validated them on [The W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/).
The same applies to my css which I have validated on [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

1. Navbar
* Going through each of the pages, I clicked on each navigation bar link to ensure all pages worked individually.

2. Social Media links
- I went to the social media links on each of the pages and clicked on them to ensure they opened up in new tabs using 'target="_blank"'.

3. Portfolio thumbnails
- Went to each thumbnail and checked that they linked to the correct project.

4. Portfolio images
- I checked whether the porfolio images enlarged correctly without overflowing over the page on a range of different device sizes

5. Contact form
- I checked the contact form was responsive and that the contact email was sent if used.

6. Website links
- I checked if all of the links to the projects external websites were correct and they opened in a new window using 'target="_blank"'.

This website was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft edge.) It is also responsive, having
tested it on chrome developer tools across ipad, various iphones, samsungs etc. I have also tested it on iphones, a macbook
and desktop.
